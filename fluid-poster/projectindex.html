				<section4><p3>Typography has been one of the most fundamental elements in the Design field. Looking from the outside of the Design world, typography is more of a medium that carries messages. However, typography as a medium has such strong characteristics that it influences and changes the meaning of the message.</p3></section4>

				<section5><p2>From letterpress<br/>to web typography.</p2></section5>
				<section6><p3>Letterpress as a creative process of formatting words and information is relatively more rigid than other technology. It is designed to align letters and words in a static and structural format. It was invented back in the mid-15th century as a practical printing technique and, in a bigger sense, a pure carrier of messages. When printing, there are plenty of limitations on typefaces, font sizes, kerning, leading, and others. The characteristics of types are only meant for
									the clear delivery of messages, not for artistic expression.
									<br/><br/>
									Seeing as now we spend more time reading on screens, types are expected to adapt to this digital environment as we do. Compared to traditional print media, the web and digital environment provide a dynamic space where data and information are constantly transforming and circulating. Adapting to this new medium, typefaces are then free from traditional limitations and start to develop their own characteristics, which not only respond to the larger environmental change but also use this platform to further reflect the message. Designers have started to push typography further and further to accelerate, emphasize, clarify, or classify communication. Typography no longer has to stay in one format but can transform, be restructured, respond to interactions, and take on and perform more characteristics. Just as what you see on this webpage, typography is not (but can be) fixed to its ground: it is fluid.</p3></section6>

				<section6><p3>As a graphic designer who just began to practice letterpress, I find the transition between digital design and traditional printmaking very interesting.
									There is a difference on many levels when thinking about design and layout. Using HTML and CSS, I design a series of web posters that are responsive, transformable, and interactive to the
									screen. The grid system can be seen as a juxtaposition of static letterpress layout in the digital environment.
